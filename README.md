I like to think about code, logic, and the strange beauty behind how things work.
For me, computer science is more than syntax; it’s philosophy written in bits and functions.

I enjoy building systems, breaking patterns, and finding elegance in algorithms.
Always exploring, from the smallest atom of an idea to the biggest questions of computation.
